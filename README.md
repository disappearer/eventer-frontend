# Eventer frontend project

This is the frontend project for a demo web app that handles events (like Facebook does).

If it is not yet, it should be served [here](http://eventer.lexlabs.tk) in the very near future.

Backend project repo is [here](https://github.com/disappearer/eventer).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
